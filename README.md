**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

I know i dont have images or videos yet, I just want to get my Syntax right first. I also forgot to hit git push before my last submission, so it was not totally updated.
